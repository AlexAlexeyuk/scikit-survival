    """Concordance index for right-censored data

    The concordance index is defined as the proportion of all comparable pairs
    in which the predictions and outcomes are concordant.

    Samples are comparable if for at least one of them an event occurred.
    If the estimated risk is larger for the sample with a higher time of
    event/censoring, the predictions of that pair are said to be concordant.
    If an event occurred for one sample and the other is known to be
    event-free at least until the time of event of the first, the second
    sample is assumed to *outlive* the first.
    When predicted risks are identical for a pair, 0.5 rather than 1 is added
    to the count of concordant pairs.
    A pair is not comparable if an event occurred for both of them at the same
    time or an event occurred for one of them but the time of censoring is
    smaller than the time of event of the first one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event_indicator : array-like, shape = (n_samples,)
        Boolean array denotes whether an event occurred

    event_time : array-like, shape = (n_samples,)
        Array containing the time of an event or time of censoring

    estimate : array-like, shape = (n_samples,)
        Estimated risk of experiencing an event

    tied_tol : float, optional, default: 1e-8
        The tolerance value for considering ties.
        If the absolute difference between risk scores is smaller
        or equal than `tied_tol`, risk scores are considered tied.

    Returns
    -------
    cindex : float
        Concordance index

    concordant : int
        Number of concordant pairs

    discordant : int
        Number of discordant pairs

    tied_risk : int
        Number of pairs having tied estimated risks

    tied_time : int
        Number of comparable pairs sharing the same time

    """Concordance index for right-censored data based on inverse probability of censoring weights.

    This is an alternative to the estimator in :func:`concordance_index_censored`
    that does not depend on the distribution of censoring times in the test data.
    Therefore, the estimate is unbiased and consistent for a population concordance
    measure that is free of censoring.

    It is based on inverse probability of censoring weights, thus requires
    access to survival times from the training data to estimate the censoring
    distribution. Note that this requires that survival times `survival_test`
    lie within the range of survival times `survival_train`. This can be
    achieved by specifying the truncation time `tau`.
    The resulting `cindex` tells how well the given prediction model works in
    predicting events that occur in the time range from 0 to `tau`.

    The estimator uses the Kaplan-Meier estimator to estimate the
    censoring survivor function. Therefore, it is restricted to
    situations where the random censoring assumption holds and
    censoring is independent of the features.

    Parameters
    ----------
    survival_train : structured array, shape = (n_train_samples,)
        Survival times for training data to estimate the censoring
        distribution from.
        A structured array containing the binary event indicator
        as first field, and time of event or time of censoring as
        second field.

    survival_test : structured array, shape = (n_samples,)
        Survival times of test data.
        A structured array containing the binary event indicator
        as first field, and time of event or time of censoring as
        second field.

    estimate : array-like, shape = (n_samples,)
        Estimated risk of experiencing an event of test data.

    tau : float, optional
        Truncation time. The survival function for the underlying
        censoring time distribution :math:`D` needs to be positive
        at `tau`, i.e., `tau` should be chosen such that the
        probability of being censored after time `tau` is non-zero:
        :math:`P(D > \\tau) > 0`. If `None`, no truncation is performed.

    tied_tol : float, optional, default: 1e-8
        The tolerance value for considering ties.
        If the absolute difference between risk scores is smaller
        or equal than `tied_tol`, risk scores are considered tied.

    Returns
    -------
    cindex : float
